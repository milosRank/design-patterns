/*
    Prototype Coding Exercise

    Given the definitions shown in code, you are asked to implement Line.deepCopy() 
    to perform a deep copy of the given Line  object. This method should return a copy of a 
    Line that contains copies of its start/end points.

    TASK SETUP:

    class Point {
        constructor(x, y)
        {
            this.x = x;
            this.y = y;
        }
    }

    class Line {

        constructor(start, end)
        {
            this.start = start;
            this.end = end;
        }

        deepCopy()
        {
            // todo
        }
    }
