/*
    Singleton Coding Exercise

    Since implementing a singleton is easy, you have a different challenge: write a function called isSingleton(). 
    This method takes a factory (i.e., a function that returns an object).
    It's up to you to determine whether or not that object is a singleton instance or not.


    TASK SETUP:

    class SingletonTester {

        static isSingleton(generator)
        {
            // todo
        }
    }
